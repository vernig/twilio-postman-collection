## Contributing

This repo is using the script `convert.js` to convert the API definitions defined in [this repo](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-cli-core/tree/master/src/services/twilio-api). Since these files are in Open API format, they could be directly imported in Postman; the problem is that postman create folders based on URL folder, which is not an effective way with Twilio APIs. 

The script is: 
* Processing each file in `src` folder. It uses the file name to create the name of the folder in Postman 
* Each `path` in the source file is used to create a subfolder of request 
* Each request is named using: `<method> + <resource>`. So for example a `GET` to an `account` is named as `Fetch account`

To generate a new output file use: 
```
node convert.js
```
